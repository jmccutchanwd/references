# Command Line Interface (CLI)

If you are using Windows have the Git Bash package installed, since you'll be learning \*nix commands for the 
following actions.

## Rule \#1 of command line

**Always know where you are**

## Basic commands

1. `cd` - change directory.
1. `pwd` - print working directory; show where you are.
1. `mkdir` - make directory.
1. `ls` - list contents of a directory.
1. `clear` - clear the view.
1. `touch` - create file. 
1. `cat` - read the contents of a file.
1. `cp` - copy files and directories.
1. `mv` - move files and directories.
1. `rm && rm -rf` - remove and remove files and folders (delete).

## Advanced commands & options

1. Perform actions that affect the entire machine with `sudo`
1. Quickly edit files with vim `vi filename`
1. Use `mkdir -p` to automatically make every directory in a new path
1. Use wildcards when moving or copying files, e.g. `cp *.js ./`
1. Use the `-r` option with `mv` or `cp` to recursively perform the action on all sub-directories
1. Use double bang `!!` to repeat last command, or prefix it with `sudo`, for example.

Use the `man` command to learn more about the other commands below. For example, `man touch` tells you everything 
you need to know about the `touch` command. Just press `q` when you're done reading the content.

1. Go through the CodeAcademy [command line course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line).
1. **List all processes on your machine**. Learn about the `ps` command to find processes on your machine. For advanced 
usage, combine it with grep to find a specific process.
1. **View processes, live, with stats**. Try the `top` command to monitor running processes in real time.
1. **curl your way on the Web**. You can "surf the web" on the command line using `curl`. Read the docs and see what 
happens when you use `curl` instead of a web browser.
1. **Find the process using a port**. There's a way to see which port every process that's running is listening 
on (if applicable). It's `lsof -i`. To find the process listening on a specific port, you add a second argument that is 
the port number - `lsof -i :8080`.
1. **Securely connect to remote machines**. The `ssh` command allows you to use the CLI of another computer - whether 
it's a virtual machine running on your personal computer, or a server running in one of Amazon's server farms.
